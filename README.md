## About Me

Design Verification Engineer with 4+ years of experience in pre-silicon verification of complex SoCs at HDL Design House and Capgemini. 

**Professional Background:**
- Verified high-speed interfaces and dataflow features for production SoCs
- Expertise in PCIe and AXI protocols: virtualization, power management, dataflow validation
- Proficient in SystemVerilog, UVM, and assertion-based verification
- Experienced with Verdi waveform analysis and coverage-driven verification
- Completed internal 6-month training in UVM, SystemVerilog, and AMBA protocols

**Portfolio Purpose:**

This portfolio demonstrates my ability to design and build complete testbenches from scratch. While my professional experience involves working within large-scale SoC verification environments, these projects showcase end-to-end verification skills including architecture design, protocol implementation, and coverage closure.

---

## Portfolio Highlights

- Complete UVM testbenches built from scratch
- Multiple protocol implementations (APB, UART, custom interfaces)
- Functional coverage driven methodology
- SystemVerilog Assertions for protocol checking
- Professional verification planning and documentation
- Constrained random testing, scoreboard checking

---

## Main Projects

### 01 - 4x1 Multiplexer Verification

Complete UVM testbench for 4-to-1 multiplexer with ready-valid handshake protocol. Features comprehensive functional coverage with cross-coverage, SystemVerilog Assertions for protocol checking, and 10+ test scenarios including corner cases.

[View Project](./01_mux_4x4/)

---

### 02 - Counter with Reset Handler

Counter design with asynchronous reset handling. Demonstrates advanced reset handling with process management, fork-join patterns for reset detection, and dynamic process control.

[View Project](./02_counter_reset/)

---

### 03 - APB Slave Verification

AMBA APB slave with register file. Features complete APB protocol implementation (PSEL, PENABLE, PREADY, PWRITE), Register Abstraction Layer integration, back-to-back transaction testing, and read-after-write verification.

[View Project](./03_apb_slave/)

---

### 04 - UART Verification

UART transmitter and receiver verification environment. Features bit-level timing verification, parity checking (odd, even, none), baud rate configuration, start/stop bit validation, and loopback testing.

[View Project](./04_uart/)

---

## Learning Projects

Smaller focused projects exploring specific UVM features and verification techniques:

### Register Abstraction Layer (RAL)

Exploration of UVM Register Abstraction Layer for register modeling, front-door and back-door access patterns, and register sequence development.

## About This Portfolio

This portfolio represents hands-on projects built to complement my professional experience in large-scale SoC verification. While my professional work involves established verification environments for PCIe and AXI protocols, these projects demonstrate my ability to architect and implement complete verification solutions independently.

**Objective:** Showcase comprehensive verification skills from requirements analysis through architecture design, implementation, and coverage closure that are transferable across verification projects.
